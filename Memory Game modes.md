# Home screen


# Theme 
- Shipyard bringing in animals
- Each block is a container
- Our task is to find the pairs of each animal
- Perhaps also a Noah's ark? Let's try the container theme

## Remove animation if it is a match
- Perhaps make the blocks flash green #DONE 
#### I have added a border, lets do more
- Make them grow and decrease, add new animation

## Flip animation
- Add a flip animation with 2 sides #DONE 
- image only gets removed after it gets unflipped #DONE 

## Back button
- Let us think how to use a back button here as the path is file path based currently and will be different on each device #DONE 
#### Currently just checking if the path ends in the folder name

## Match styling and extras

- Give feedback if it is a match
- Play a sound on match
- On opening one sound will play
- If its a match play a positive sound, otherwise negative
- Mute sounds button #DONE 
- make the button work
- If no match make them red and close them
- Remove from screen
- If it is a match end the timer quicker, else keep them open as long as before #DONE 
- Could disappear on pair

## Difficulties
- Try to use queries for difficulties #DONE

- If timer is under 30 it should be red #DONE 

## Block styling

- More interesting blocks #DONE 
- We can give them a background color #DONE 
- hover animation but nothing too crazy, main animation should be saved for opening #DONE 
- new images for the blocks #DONE 

## Mobile friendliness

- Test the initial version to see where we need breakpoints #DONE 
- Mobile friendly
- First we need to find out what it feels like on phones and see what the biggest issues are
- avoid all side scrolling and make sure the blocks are easy to click

## Game Over
