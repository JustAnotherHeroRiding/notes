# Home screen


# Theme 
- Shipyard bringing in animals
- Each block is a container
- Our task is to find the pairs of each animal
- Perhaps also a Noah's ark? Let's try the container theme

## Remove animation if it is a match
- Perhaps make the blocks flash green #DONE 
#### I have added a border, lets do more
- Make them grow and decrease, add new animation

## Back button
- Let us think how to use a back button here as the path is file path based currently and will be different on each device

## Match styling and extras

- Give feedback if it is a match
- Play a sound on match
- On opening one sound will play
- If if its a match play a positive sound, otherwise negative
- Mute sounds button
- If no match make them red and close them
- Remove from screen
- If it is a match end the timer quicker, else keep them open as long as before #DONE 
- Could disappear on pair

## Start Screen

- Quit will remove the screen #NotPossible
- Difficulties #DONE 
- Put quit on the bottom of the container with margin top auto from the difficulties #DONE 
- Header on start page #DONE 



## Background

- Background Image on start screen #DONE
- And on game screen #DONE 
- Background music
- Mute music button

## Difficulties
- Try to use queries for difficulties #DONE 
- Do hard difficulty #DONE 
#### generate more images
- For hard we will need more images, if the size is 6 we need 18
- Timer for each difficulties #DONE 
- Board accepts an object of 3 settings #DONE 
- If timer is under 1 min it should be yellow #DONE 
- If timer is under 30 it should be red #DONE 

## Block styling

- More interesting blocks #DONE 
- We can give them a background color
- hover animation but nothing too crazy, main animation should be saved for opening #DONE 

## Mobile friendliness

- Mobile friendly
- First we need to find out what it feels like on phones and see what the biggest issues are
- avoid all side scrolling and make sure the blocks are easy to click

## Game Over
- New animation for game over if timer is finished
- If game is over stop all game logic
- Try again button on game over screen
- play a sound when losing or winning

## in game counters
- turns
- correct guesses
- misses
- accuracy percentage
- speed drop down selector
- show number checkbox to use numbers instead of images
- cancel button to go back
